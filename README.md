# Plain-Academic Template
Website tempalte obtianed from : https://github.com/mavroudisv/plain-academic/tree/master

A truly simple website template for academics. It was developed with simplicity in mind (both in terms of style and in code complexity).

Just download the two files (index.html and photo.gif) and start editing straightaway.

Please do not remove the attibution link of the template, so that other people can find it too.
